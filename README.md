# webpack4vue
Boilerplate Vue Application with Vue Router built with Webpack4

This is a basic SPA like Vue application, which has some basic Webpack4 build scripts. See the /build directory for the webpack config files. A linting script has been included, but isn't a part of the dev build script (yet). Stylus is the styling language. Babel is used for JS transpiling.
